Syntax highlighting support for the Comet programming language

## Features

Syntax highlighting support for the Comet programming language

## Known Issues

It can't tell the difference between `nil` the keyword and `nil?` the function, so they both show up as `nil` the keyword.  I don't think it handles lambda functions terribly well.

## Release Notes

Initial release with basic highlighting support

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Comet Lang
